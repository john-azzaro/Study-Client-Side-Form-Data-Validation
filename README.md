## What is the Form Data Validation Study?
The Form Data Validation Study is a handy exploration of data verification of form submissions.  In this example (see live demo), the user can
submit a name and a password.  Additional logic has been provided to make sure that the user submits a name and password that meet a certain criteria, such 
as a length minimum/limit, whether or not a password or name is provided and, if not, needs to be provided to successfully submit.

Here's some questions covered in the study:

## Does Form Validation Study feature commentary?
Yes! Commentary be found in html, css, and javascripty files.  Additionally, I created a process notes file which gives a slightly more in-depth walk-through of
my process in implementing the form validation logic.
